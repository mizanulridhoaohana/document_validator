# Autonomus Document Validator

This project is designed to automate the process for document administrators by verifying the authenticity of documents. Specifically, a document is considered valid if it contains both a stamp and a signature.

To achieve this, I used the advanced YOLOv5 architecture. This choice was driven by YOLOv5's capability to perform both object detection and classification simultaneously with high accuracy. The system efficiently identifies and verifies essential elements on documents, ensuring that each processed document meets the required authenticity standards.
